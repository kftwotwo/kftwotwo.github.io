## Thanksgiving Break part 2
Now our bellies are full and we are ready for a nap. That's how I felt yesterday and I couldn't eat another bite to even save my life. I had a great day yesterday with my family cooked a ham and a bunch of other sides! We relaxed and watch tv and game on our computers. I found a new game it looks cool for free on steam but I'll let you know how it is. Well my best friend just got a 4K tv for a deal. Gosh i can't wait for him to move to Portland with me. I'll be coming back to my home state for x-mas and I'm thinking about surprising him, I don't know yet. Well i hope everyone had a good holiday and traveled safe.
