## Thanksgiving Break
So I just started my ruby class it's going pretty good besides most of pairs, I paired up with didn't do there homework which there was a lot of it so I got pretty frustrated with them but I guess thats why they have the pairing program so you can adapt to others skill levels and learn how to deal with frustrations like mine appropriately. Now I have to polish up on somethings and hopefully reach my mentor's expectations soon so I can prosper and get a good job. So week 1 is down now and next week is objects so I'm practicing over this break to get better. Happy ThanksGiving everybody
