This is my last week with pairing programing. Next week we have independent projects our code review. For the independent projects to come up with a project idea and last for a week for our MVP. What I decided to work on is my brother's website for training. During this week my mentor has been teaching how to use Jira and how to write stories/features. Also for next week I have my mock interviews. I feel that I have my non-technical interview down. My brother has been coaching me through how to do an actual interview. In the shop business you walk in and do some sort of test to prove yourself. But I still need to work on my technical interview because so of my terms or definitions are not completely correct.

Anyways I am excited for my internship, I have a few on my radar but I'm still deciding on my top 5. There is one close by where I live may I could save some gas or bike fees. I'm looking to work on real work, I see some companies description's say "You will be create a application of your choice "
