Well my brother in law told me to download Postman I didn't know what it was but today I saw on stack over flow about Postman and followed along with some examples and now I've learn one purpose or use of it. Checking api keys and urls and choosing how to view it like json, HTML, XML and Text but today went pretty good got bikeindex.org api working today and giving information. I also learned how to use pictures in markdown files.
