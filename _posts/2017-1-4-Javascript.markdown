Today I learned what Postman is about. My brother in law told me to download Postman. I didn't know what it was but today I saw on stack over flow about Postman and followed along with some examples. Now I've learn one purpose of it like checking api keys/urls. They let you choose how to view it like json, HTML, XML and Text.

Today went pretty good got bikeindex.org api working today so I'm getting data back. Tommorrow the BikeIndex project should be done. I want to take it a step further and use the google API to mark the bike's location on where it was stolen.

I also learned how to use pictures in markdown files!
