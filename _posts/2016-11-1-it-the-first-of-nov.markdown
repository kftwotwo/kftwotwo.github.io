## Day 17
Everything is going great sense I studied last weekend so this week so far is going great! We have been learning about objects in javascript when and how to use them and why they are so useful. I'am starting see how people are in a bigger city. Coming from a small hick town to "Keep Portland Weird" I don't mind it at all it's fun to see something different every day. Oh guess what.... I'am the youngest in the class right now I'm 19 turning 20 in December and I've been making some new friends in school. A few students have the same interests as me it's kinda fun to "geek out" and actually talk to someone who knows what they are talking about instead of somebody lying about it. It's fun to call them out on it too because they know I know that they have no idea on what we are talking about. Well so far day 17 I'am still in it to win and thats my goal!
