##Happy New Year
I hope everyone had a good new year I did for sure. Im excited for this year this is the year I'm going to get a job and a place on my own and be an adult. Just got back from Montana everything is the same nothing has changed everyone is doing good. I'm glad my family flew me out it was good to see them for a little bit and visit is friend. So far the homework for this next course isn't too bad but still little peachy on some of it like the gulpfile kind of hard to wrap my head around it but I'm ready to get back at it!
