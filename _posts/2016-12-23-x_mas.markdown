## Brace your self....
Hey everyone for this x-mas break I'm heading back to Montana is should be fun even it -30 below but I'll just bring extra jackets and try to stay warm. I'll try to blog in Montana because I'm bring my windows laptop maybe I'll figure about how to do vlogs on this website most likely links to youtube or something and a thumb nail who knows. These past few weeks ive been busy I went to my first tech meet up called metal toad, it's a meet up to get extra help and advice for your projects or in general. Then I made a few friends from class and made a ping-pong table and meet different people from the area and
had a great night. Until a homeless person asked me for change and I told him "i don't carry cash" when he was walking away he hit my aux cord to my headphones and my NEW phone fell striaght on it's face and shattered. Oh well I'll fix it later. Im going to wrap this up everyone have a good holiday and travel safe.
