## Day
Today was a pretty good day we are in a group of four and working on this kickass text adventure its going to have mini map of where you are and what objects are around you. Its already cool and how we pulled in functions to move around with arrows and finally figured out how to make a mini map to show where you are. Besides that I'm really liking this group project idea. I think we are going to have the best text adventure in the class a few groups are going to have a similar idea as us but I think we are going to knock this out of the park!!
