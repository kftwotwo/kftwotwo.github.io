I nailed all of my interviews for the internships. I am glad that my brother prepared me for the interviews. I got really good feed-back I know this was from [lumen learning](http://lumenlearning.com/) "He did a great job explaining his project technically and what it solves. Also showed good organization skills in how he developed his project". But the rest of them I do not know because [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) does not specify. Here is the rest of the feed-back "Kevin asked good questions", "Kevin passion seems to be more focused in back end development. With good guidance, we have no doubt he would excel in that area.", and "A natural tinkerer and programmer. I would bet that eventually you end up somewhere in hardware or systems architecture as you would have a knack for it. Look forward to having you on the team if we get matched!".

So by the image above you can probably tell which internship I got. I started on Wednesday, we went over the project they want us to work on. I do not know if I can talk about it much. I am still pretty excited to gain some more knowledge and experience. So this week I am updating the test, for testing we are using rspec. But I am contributing to real work for the company! I was affraid of creating a project that has nothing to deal with the company.

On a different subject a game just came out that I want to get. It's called PlayerUnknown Battleground, it's a better version H1Z1. What I mean is there is more weapons, different maps, and a lot of customizable weapons depending what you have looted. This is built with unreal engine 4 and this game has only been in 9 months of development. Just watching some streamers they have a lot less bugs than H1Z1. So when I get a job that is going to be my next investment!
