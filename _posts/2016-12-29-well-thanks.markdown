## Guess who's back?....
Well i flew into Montana it's only -15 outside, where it dries out your skin and hurts to breath and the wind dries out your eyes! I hope everyone had a great holiday and traveled safe! So I've been hanging out with my best friend and making videos and screwing around just having fun I'll out a link down for his youtube channel down below. My family is doing good my little sister is getting so big but yet she so adorable but besides that I'm ready to head back to Portland but not excited to for the next course JavaScript I love ruby and excited for rails!
