I have been watching this game for a while now. It's suppost to destroy H1Z1 in every way. Note that I love H1Z1 but there are some bugs and glitches that could be worked on. I hope this up coming update will cover most of those bugs. They have a test server, where they test there work I know it sounds obvious. With this update that they are working on includes a new UI for the vehicles. So they have included a tachometer with a few minor changes. When vehicle gets damaged parts start failing like the turbo etc.

One parts in this update is a ping-lock which gives you a warning on the UI(user interface) when your ping is low. Then your weapons get locked so you can't shoot. Which sounds stupid but it's so important to me because some how people walk through buildings, houses, and trees then they eliminate me. Which ticks me off, I wouldn't call it an advantage but it's a bug that they are working on. One of the most import parts with this update too is a region-lock. What the region-lock does is locks your position according to you IP address. So you can't play against people in another country without some work arounds. Right now you can choose what region you can play in, unfortunately  I do not speak any other language right now. This game requires a lot of communication specially if you are on a team. Another reason why region-lock is a great part of this update is because the people. You may asked why the people? Well if  join a random team and don't speak their language they will find you on the map and kill you. Just for kicks and giggles because you are a easy target. This has happened to me many times, it almost makes the game unplayable for my friends and I.

So [Playerunknown's Battlegrounds](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/) by [Bluehole Studio](https://www.bluehole.net/en/) has been in nine months of development. So far by surfing [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com) some people have done some great gameplay/reviews on this game. Here is a description of the game, players will enter a last-man-standing battle where they try to locate weapons, vehicles and supplies in a graphically and tactically rich battleground. Eventually players are forced into a shrinking play zone as they engage in a tense and spectacular fight to the death.


This game will put up to 100 players on a remote island. Which H1Z1 does not, so this prevents server hog which is an excessive load on a server which may cause performance issues for users on that server. Let's talk about the guns, so Playerunknown's Battlegrounds offers realistic gunplay mechanics 17 weapons and 35 attachments. With H1Z1 they offer 12 weapons(not including crafted items) and ZERO attachments. I guess they kind of make it up for crafting but the only weapons you can create is with arrows.

So I am bashing H1Z1, I love the game but it needs some serous work. I am super excited for the new update coming out later this month. When I get a job and stable enough I am going to purchase the Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.
