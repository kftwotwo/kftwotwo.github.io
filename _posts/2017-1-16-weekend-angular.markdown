## Angular 2
So today I'm going through the lessons that epicodus provides and made a template because they recommended it. So far I'm not sure about typescript kinda like ruby with making custom classes and some logic and dynamic custom tags but I'm ready to go back to school tomorrow and put my nose to the grinding stone.
