intro: Today the code review went pretty good, I made a message board where people can comment on the posts or edit/delete the post. When you delete a post it will delete all comments in that post.

Today not many people came to Epicodus because of the snow and ice. I'm used to snow but other people may not be here is a post about driving on snow/ice [Tips on snowy roads](http://localhost:4000/objects/2017/01/12/chains.html). Safety is always first!

Today the code review went pretty good, I made a message board where people can comment on the posts or edit/delete the post with Ember. When you delete a post it will delete all comments in that post. I hope Angular is easier because it is hard to follow all the actions when you keep sending them up to the 'root'. They told us to keep all of our logic in a 'root' I don't know if that is correct so don't blame the messenger boy.
