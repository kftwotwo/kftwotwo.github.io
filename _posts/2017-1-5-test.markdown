Today my partner and I made a app call BikeIndex. We are using the API from [BikeIndex](https://bikeindex.org/). We got the google api to display a map then tried to add drop pins of the location of the stolen bikes of the current location given.

The new class that just started the Intro course are getting frustrated about the terminal commands and bootstrap. To think about it at that time I was too because I was used to a windows and didn't know how to use a mac. I was a die hard for windows because of gaming. I was scrolling through my old projects on [Github](https://github.com/kftwotwo) and compare them to the projects now is pretty embarrassing to me but that shows that I have made a lot of progress for 3 months. Another 3 months of this I'll probably say the same thing.

My advice is to stick with it and don't be embarrassed on slow you are going. Your partner should understand that you are both there to learn and to work together.
