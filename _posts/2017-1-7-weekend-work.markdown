intro: So this weekend we are going to using ember a MTC or model-template-controller so far it's going pretty good. I love the fact that I don't have to play around making predefined or pre-made files and folders kind of like sql commands to active-record.

So this weekend we are going to using ember a MTC or model-template-controller so far it's going pretty good. I love the fact that I don't have to play around making predefined or pre-made files and folders kind of like sql commands to active-record.

I dove into firebase by google, Epicodus didn't explain their selves on what it is or what it is used for. So I did my research on what it does, I hope we go into it more in depth with this course. It definitely caught my attention and seems really useful in a project I have in mind. That project is Top Secret! I'm just joking around, I actully have a few projects in mind like ModIt. ModIt is about cars and truck that other people have modded out like.

These kind of people are very passionate about their modded out vehicle. It resembles them on their creativity, personality, and problem solving. Most of the time they do all the work themselves or with friends! You might be thinking that's over kill but the us it's beautiful it shows what kind of person you are.
