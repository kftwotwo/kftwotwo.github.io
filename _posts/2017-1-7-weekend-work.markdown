![Ember](http://emberjs.com/images/tomster-sm.png) ![Firebase](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/firebase-logo.jpeg)

So this weekend we are going to using ember a MTC or model-template-controller so far it's going pretty good I love the fact that I don't have to play around making predefined or premade files and folders kinda like sql commands to active-record. I kinda of drove in to firebase by google epicodus didn't explain them selves what it is or what it is used for so I had to research on what it did I hope we go into it more in depth with this course it definitely caught my attention and seems really useful in a project I have in mind.
