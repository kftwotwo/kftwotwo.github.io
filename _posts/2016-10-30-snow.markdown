## Got to love Montana
Well my friend and I where going to head into town but guess what snow happened! At 8 am 13 inches went over to my friends house saw 3 city folks in the ditch. Some people don't know how to drive in snow and ice. Then I went home couldn't see 2 feet away in front of my father's car still snowing. Let's just say I'm so ready to head back to Portland and get back to school! Well I leave tomorrow back hopefully my flight wont be delayed.
