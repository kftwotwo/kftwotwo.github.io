intro: Today I paired with a student who has some experience with Python and JavaScript. He's a good resource as a go to person. He explained to me about the gulpfile in a ruby way. Now I understand it, it is like a raking.

Today I paired with a student who has some experience with Python and JavaScript. He's a good resource as a go to person. He explained to me about the gulpfile in a ruby way. Now I understand it, it is like a raking because I'm creating tasks. I know it is probably wrong or poorly thought out but that's how I interpreted it. I think I'm doing good for the most part I have to work on my terminology so I'm not confusing myself.

Instead of just JavaScript it's TextScript for me it's hard to write it's syntax. I'll probably get the hang of it soon but that's why I'm in this course!
