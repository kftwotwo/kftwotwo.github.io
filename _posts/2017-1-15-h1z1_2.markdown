So now its been 24 hours since I have had this game I'm getting better now you can craft stuff like healing products or weapons modifications. My team and I won our first king of the kill match. They actually implied a bullet drop like in real life witch is pretty cool.

They made real life stuff like cars having keys, gas, and able to be hot wired. Armor has a percent on how much damaged it has. If you like survival games with guns and crafting stuff i recommend this game. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 it would be a 9 because the graphics could use some love besides that its an amazing game!
