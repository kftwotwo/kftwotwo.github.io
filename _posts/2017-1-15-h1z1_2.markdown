## H1Z1
So now its been 24 hours since I have had this game I'm getting better now you can craft some stuff for healing products or weapons mods but today my team and I won our first king of the hill match. They actually made a bullet drop like in real life witch is pretty cool they made a lot "real life action" stuff like cars having keys and armor actually giving out so then you have to make more. If you like survival games with guns and crafting stuff i recommend this game. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 it would be a 9 because the graphics could use some love besides that its an amazing game!
