So for the code review today, we are supposed to use the [Better Doctor API](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) to list doctors. With that list of doctors you can obtain information like where did they go to school, their office hours and so much information you can use in your app.

For my project you are able to search for a doctor's names, what they specialized in, and their email. With my app you are able to type in a symptom like a backache it would list the most qualified doctors for your back pain and list their email, bio, and office(s).

My day started out good, I finished my gulpfile in 15 minutes and got all my packages installed. Then I was copping the API key for my environment file. I got so stumped pretty good about my API key. I got an error saying my API key was invalid.

So I took these actions trying to solve this problem:

* I checked my requiring statement and that was correct
* Then checked routing to see if it was wrong but that was correct

At this point I've not checked my API key. I used Postman to check my api, but I was not getting any data back. I copied it again from Better Doctor, it turned out to be I added a letter in the key. So lesson learned always check your API key so you don't get to the point of banging your against a wall. After that was fixed everything went smooth, so with my spare time I made a footer for my portfolio and blog which I think it looks pretty damn good for my first polished footer.
