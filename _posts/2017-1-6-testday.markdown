So for the code review today, we are supposed to use the [Better Doctor API](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) to list doctors. With that list of doctors you can obtain information like where did they go to school, their office hours there is so much information you can use in your app. For my project you are able to search for a doctor's name, what they specialized in, and their email. You if you had a symptom like a backache it would list the most qualified doctors for your back pain.

My day started out good, I got my gulpfile done in 15 minutes and got all my packages installed. Then I was copping the API key for my environment file. I got so stumped pretty good about to bang my head against a wall trying to figure out why my API key was not working. I tripled checked my requiring statement and that was correct, so I thought I was routing it wrong but that was correct. After checking everything by this point I've not checked my API key it turns out to be I added a letter in the key. After that everything went pretty smooth then with my spare time I made a footer for my portfolio and blog which I think it looks pretty damn good for my first polished footer.
