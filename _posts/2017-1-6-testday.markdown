So for the code review or test is what I like to call it, we are supposed to use the [Better Doctor API](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) to list doctors. my day started out good got my gulpfile done in 15 mins from scratch and got all my packages installed and save so they can run two commands and have it running. Then I was copping the api key and for about two and a half hours latter about to bang my head against a wall trying to figure out why my api key was not working it turns out to be I add a letter in the key. After that everything went pretty smooth then I got distracted with making a footer for my portfolio has a real google feel to it and I think lit looks pretty damn good.
