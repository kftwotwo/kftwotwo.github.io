Hello everyone, we got some snow the pasted few days. I see a lot of people having trouble driving in the snow. Before I dive in I'm going to tell you a little about myself. I grew up in Montana where snow and ice are very normal. I worked at a welding shop where it was a requirement for me to get a [CDL (Commercial Driver's License) class A](http://www.cdldigest.com/cdl/) so I can deliver products to the mines in my area. I had to drive in all conditions so I've some experience.

***Today I am going to give you some helpful tips driving on snow/ice.***
```
* Give more room between each vehicle
* Don't swerve or try to correct yourself if out of control
* Do not slam on your brakes just slow down
* Check your tires to see if you need new ones
* Pack a 'cold bag' for an emergency
* Don't floor it and spin out, remember nice and easy gets you there breezy
* Be more aware of your surroundings
* Do not use your high beams for a snow storm
```

Before you go out on the road you would want to do an inspection by you or a mechanic. First check your tires if they are bald replace them immediately. Always keep your windows brushed and clean because visibility is important. If you can't see you are creating a dangerous environment for you and others. Now you should pack a 'cold bag' in your vehicle for emergencies.

***In your cold bag:***
```
* flash light with extra batteries
* road flares or reflective warning triangles
* warm clothes/blankets
* jumper cables or jumper pack
* first aid kit
* water
* cell phone charger
* Collapsible shovel
* cat litter or dirt
* chains
```
Most of those items are standard, you can never over pack for being on the road. You might ask me what is the cat litter or dirt for?

Let's say are stuck on a little hill and it's all ice. You don't have any chains to assist you up the hill. Sprinkle some dirt or cat littler in the direction you are headed to gain some traction.
