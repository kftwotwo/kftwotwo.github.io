## Chains?
Okay it just snowed recently I would say around 11 inches I have never seen so many people pulled over and throw on chains in my life time. I think chain are alright but they can be more dangerous in my opinion because eventuallys they make the road wash boardy making it more dangerous than just ice because you will have barely any traction on they ice but oh well just my opinion. All I have to say is take it nice and slow you will get there safe!
