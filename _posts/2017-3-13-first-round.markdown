So now we are done with Epicodus's course. New we have to choose an internship. They gave us a list of companies that want interns. I have chosen Sitecast as my first choice, then Lumen Learning, SimB & Company, and InboundRX. Today I did my interview with Sitecast. It started out really well, they as me why am I transferring job careers to coding instead of welding. I told them that there is more job opportunities and I can grow more in coding and keep learning all the time.

Then we reviewed my assignment they gave me, I met all requirements that they were asking. It looked nice considering the time they gave me. The assignment was about using bootstrap and it's elements to create a nice looking webpage. 

Overall they said it's sounds like I am a great fit for the intern position. With Sitecast as a intern we would be learning the React framework with Ruby on Rails. Epicodus was going to teach React but they didn't have the course ready yet. So I think this is a great opportunity for me to learn more an able to put that down on my resume. All of this training with my brother and his partner is paying off. But right now my number one choice is Sitecast but that might change latter on this week.
