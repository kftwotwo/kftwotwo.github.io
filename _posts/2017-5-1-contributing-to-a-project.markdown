Tonight, I went to the Ruby Brigade meet up in downtown Portland. The topic this month was "A Beginner's Guide to Open Source Software(OSS)". Dana who was the speaker, shared what she has learned as an OSS maintainer with the Cucumber core team. This talk was aimed at people who want to get their toes wet in OSS, but are not sure how to get started.


First she talked about how it will look on your resume. Employers like to see an applicant contributing to an OSS. This shows that you are donating you time help or create software on your free time. Also, this will represent an image that you are always learning and you have the passion to code.


Second she explained the benefits of working with others on a OSS. Communicating with others will help you develop your people skills. In the process, you will be making connections when asking others for help. Some may become mentors for other developers. When creating a pull request you will have to explain how and why you do things the way you did. This process is called code reviewing and this is where you get the most learning done.


She gave us advice about contributorâ€™s environments. If they are being rude or not wanting your presence, she told us to move on. If you are looking to contribute to an OSS she recommends a website rubygems.org. The reason why is because there are thousands of gems you can contribute to and most of them have great communities.


We also talked about forking communities. If you have a new feature and your pull request gets denied and you decide to fork it. Do not create a different community other than the original community. The reason behind this is because the community has pride in their software and you didn't create it.


I hope you found this post interesting and helpful!
