## Badass game?
So today I did more than half of my angular lessons around 10 pm last night my friends convinced me to get a pc game called H1Z1 on steam its a hard core team played game and you have to work together to win. Being the noob in this game I'm so used to fps (first person shooters) like call of duty. My team mates are my friends back in Montana and they love this game for me I can say the graphics aren't the best but I love every thing else about this game.
