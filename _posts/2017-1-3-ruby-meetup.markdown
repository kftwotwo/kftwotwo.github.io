intro: Last night I went to Ruby Brigade meet up with a few class mates. Some of the material went over my head because I haven't done the rails part of my course. I did understand the authentication part of it. My partner and I were getting different keys from Github and for some reason.

Last night I went to Ruby Brigade meet up with a few class mates. Some of the material went over my head because I haven't done the rails part of my course. I did understand the authentication part of it. My partner and I were getting different keys from Github and for some reason it was working. We both moved on and said it was ruby magic. No actually makes a public key for the app to see so the developers can't see any private keys. So that explains why we getting 2 different keys.

I love the offices here they look so nice and seems relaxed and clean. It's so high in the sky, I just love looking over the city. I'm used to a dirty environments, even the offices. I'm excited to get a job when I have completed Epicodus's courses.
