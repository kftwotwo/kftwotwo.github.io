## I love this career!
Well I went to Ruby Brigade meet up with a few class mates some of the material went over my head because I haven't done the rails part of my course but I did understand the authentication part of it because we were getting different keys from Github and for some reason it was working but we moved on and said it was magic. It actually makes a public key for the app to see so the developers can't see any private keys. I love the offices here they look so nice and seems relaxed and clean. I used to a dirty environments even the offices but I'm excited to get a job when I have completed Epicodus's courses.
